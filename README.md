ABC Writer
==========

![A screenshot of the app on Android](doc/screenshot.jpg)

ABC Writer is a small (QtQuick-based) application where children have to draw a
letter with a finger by staying inside the letter's ``area''.

The child's strokes and mistakes (slipping out of the letter) are logged on the
device.

Originally designed to be used as a simple pre-test/post test for the [CoWriter
project](http://chili.epfl.ch/cowriter).
